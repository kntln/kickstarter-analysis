# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 The project will present the outcomes of the campaign based on two factors: launch date and goal amount. Different analyses such as finding the percentage rate of success, failed and cancelled were performed to generate results and conclusion based on the two factors. Moreover, challenges and diifculties were also discussed as well as the limitation and future direction of the project. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to generate insights that will help Louise guide future decisions in organizing campaigns by means of data analysis and data visualization. Specifically, we will be looking at how launch date affects the theater outcomes.Furthermore, this project also sheds light on how different goal amount affects the outcomes of the campaign.    

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Campaign outcomes: successsful, failed, and canceled, were analyzed based on their launched date. This was achieved by taking the launchdate of the campaigns and separating the date by month. The number of successful, cancelled and failed outcomes were tallied by each month. A line graph was generated to better visualize the results.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaign goal amount were broken down to 12 brackets starting from amount less than 1000 to campaign amount with 50,000 or more. After the goal amount was broken down, the number of outcomes based on goal amount were gathered. In addition, the total projects based on the respective goal amount were counted in order to generate the percentage of success, failed and canceled for each outcomes. A line graph was created to illustrate the outcomes based on goal amount.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges and difficulties encountered in this assignment are, creating a pivot table for the outcomes based on launch date. I had a hard time organizing the data to their respective rows and columns to generate a cohesive visualization of the data. The challenge was overcame by having a good understanding on which factors should be represented, in addition having a reference picture really helped in orienting me to the right table. Another challenge that I encountered is creating COUNTIFS for the outcomes based on goal. I had errors in my equation and therefore, I had difficulties extracting the data that I need for the analysis. I was able to resolve this difficulty by carefully watching the video for creating COUNTIFS. The video helped me see the errors in my equation, for instance, I needed to create a range for goal amounts such as 1000 to 4999.   

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the launch date of the campaigns by month for the theater category, at first glance, the graph illustrates that the failed outcomes follows the same pattern as the successful outcomes but to a lesser extent. For example, as the proportion of successful outcomes increases, the failed outcomes are also increasing. However, looking closely at the graph, this is not always the case. Therefore one conclusion that can be derived from this data is that campaigns started around the period of May and early June, have a higher probability of success as opposed to campaigns that started on December which had the lowest success rate. Another interesting conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the lowest success rate is not necessarily the highest failure rate. For instance during May and October, the number of failed outcomes is at the greatest but this not necesasrily mean that those period had the lowest proportion of success outcomes. This implies that there are factors affecting the theater outcomes which can be studied for future analysis. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One conclusion that can be drawn from Outcomes based on goal amount, is that percentage of success and percentage of failure are direct invserse of one another. In addition, as illustrated on the graph, goals with less than 1000 have the most success compared to the extreme end of the campaign goal amount which is 50,000 or more. One factor to note however, is that the success of the fundraising outcomes does not necessarily decrease as the goal amount increases. For instance, goal amount of 35,000 to 39,000 and 40,000 to 49,000 are more successful than goals with the amount of 25,000 to 29,000. Therefore, it can be concluded that goal amount alone is not sufficient to predict the successs of the campaigns. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of this dataset are, first the goal amounts can be vastly different from one another and comparing them against one another may skew the information gathered. Another limitation of this dataset is the dataset were gathered from different countries, thus, the outcomes of the campaign may be affected by how affluent the backers in the country or in some country, the citizens are more likely to pledge than other citizen of a different country.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The other possible tables and graphs we could create are, we could create a graph analyzing the type of category that are more likely to generate a succesful outcome. In addition, we could also create a table to analyze which country have the highest rate of success outcomes. Lastly, we could also create a table to figure out what type of category has the highest probability of success for each country.
